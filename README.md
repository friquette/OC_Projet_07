# OC_Projet_07

Algorithms to calculate generated profit from shares datasets.

## How to use:
To use these algorithms, make sure to create a virtual environment first. 
Then create two folders named 'reports' and 'csv'. <br>
Put your datasets in the csv format in the 'csv' folder.

## Bruteforce:
Create a .txt file in the 'reports' folder, where your report will be written. 
Make sure the name is the same in the algorithm.
Finally open the command prompt, activate your virtual environment and enter <br>
```py bruteforce.py``` <br>
Your report will be saved in the .txt file you just created. You can interrupt the
calculation at any time, when you'll start the algorithm again, it will start where 
you stopped it.

## Optimized
Open the command prompt, activate your virtual environment and enter <br>
```py bruteforce.py``` <br>
Your report will be saved in the 'report' folder. You don't have anything else to do.
